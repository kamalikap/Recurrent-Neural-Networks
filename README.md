# Recurrent-Neural-Networks

▪ Training dataset consisted of entries of Google Stock Prices from January, 2012 to December 2016. Based on the training data, the stock prices of the financial days of January, 2017 was predicted. 
▪ Prediction was based on taking into consideration of 60 (i.e., 3 months with each month having 20 financial days) time-steps. 
▪ The RNN was built using four LSTM layers and an output layer. And it was compiled using a batch size of 32 and epochs equals to 100. 
▪ Time taken was 604 seconds and the prediction was shown in a graph.
